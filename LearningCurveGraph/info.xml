<abstract>The <b>LearningCurveGraph</b> component is an example of a(n) R component.</abstract>
<details>This component is used to visualize the graphical results of the LKT Analysis.</details>

<inputs>
    <b>transaction file from LKT</b> - LKT adds a model probability column.
    <b>KC to be plotted for each subject</b> - the graph is plotted for the repetitions of KCs, so the first value is the average proportion correct for the first time each student encounters each KC.
    <b>frequency thrshold</b> - For each graph, the proportion of transactions that trial N needs to be of trial 1 for it to be plotted. (Provides a cutoff as a proportion of the first trial N.)
</inputs>

<outputs>
<b>Figures for the plot</b> - the 2 panels are the the data before and after the longest time interval for each KC for each subject. The 2nd plot is a simple legend. Figures are numbered in the order of their attachemnt in the GUI.
</outputs>
