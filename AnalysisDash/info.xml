<abstract><b>Difficulty, Ability, and Study History (DASH):</b> Four models that add time or memory strength to a logistic regression over the "error rate" learning curve data.
<br/><br/>
The Memory Model option defaults to "Last Retention Time" (LRT) but also supports variations on the underlying cognitive model: <b>DASH</b>, <b>DASH-MCM</b> and <b>DASH-ACTR</b>. DASH-MCM stands for "Multiscale Context Model" and DASH-ACTR is "Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational". The LRT model simply adds time between opportunities as a factor.
<br/>
DASH models are taken from Michael Mozer and Robert Lindsey's work incorporating cognitive theories into big data approaches.
<br/><br/>
The Factor Type option specifies whether to use the memory factor as either a fixed effect or as a random slope on items (KCs).
