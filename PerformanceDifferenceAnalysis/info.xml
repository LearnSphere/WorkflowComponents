<abstract>This workflow component calculates performance differences for an individual course, following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07565">Koester, Grom, &amp; McKay (2016)</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858417743754">Matz et al. (2017)</a>
The target use case is calculating gendered differences (or other factor) in final grade for a target course (e.g., intro physics), esp relative to grades in other courses taken by
students in the target course. 
<p>See <a href="https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/LearnSphere?workflowId=2344" target="_blank">demo</a> workflow.</p>

<options>
<ul>
<li>Grade for Target Course: allowed values are numbers or letter grades (A, B, C, D, F, R, W)</li>
<li>GPA in Other Units: units-weighted GPA (may be cumulative, as in McKay, or single semester), must be numeric values</li>
<li>Number of Units Factored into GPA, must be numeric values</li>
<li>Anomaly Factor: for example, student's gender</li>
