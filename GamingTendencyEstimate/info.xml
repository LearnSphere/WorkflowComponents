<abstract>The <b>Gaming Tendency Estimate</b> performs a logistic regression using the student ID as a random intercept while controlling for content type to infer the latent gaming tendency of the student.</abstract>

<description>
	This component helps estimate the student's latent gaming tendency. A workflow demo for this component is provided in the following <a href="https://pslc-qa.andrew.cmu.edu/datashop/LearnSphere?workflowId=2132">link</a>.<br/>
	
	This component takes transaction logs with gaming labels as input from the Session Level Features component (Transform > Session Level Features) and computes a single latent estimate for each individual student present in the dataset.	 
</description>


<inputs>
<b>Student transaction logs with labels for inferred gaming. The gaming can be inferred using any gaming detector. The initial exploration was conducted using the rule-based gaming detector.</b>
</inputs>

<outputs>
<ul>
	<li>A tab-delimited text file estimating the individual students' gaming tendency. </li>
</ul>
</outputs>
