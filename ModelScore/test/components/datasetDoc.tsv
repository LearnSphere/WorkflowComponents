Chase and Dummer stratified their sample, selecting students from urban, suburban, and rural school districts with approximately 1/3 of their sample coming from each district.  Students indicated whether good grades, athletic ability, or popularity was most important to them.  They also ranked four factors:  grades, sports, looks, and money, in order of their importance for popularity.  The questionnaire also asked for gender, grade level, and other demographic information.\nNumber of cases:   478\nVariable Names:\n\nGender:   Boy or girl\nGrade:   4, 5 or 6\nAge:   Age in years\nRace:   White, Other\nUrban/Rural:   Rural, Suburban, or Urban school district\nSchool:   Brentwood Elementary, Brentwood Middle, Ridge, Sand, Eureka, Brown, Main, Portage, Westdale Middle\nGoals:   Student's choice in the personal goals question where options were 1 = Make Good Grades,  2 = Be Popular,  3 = Be Good in Sports\nGrades:   Rank of \""make good grades\""  (1=most important for popularity, 4=least important)\nSports:   Rank of \""being good at sports\""  (1=most important for popularity, 4=least important)\nLooks:   Rank of \""being handsome or pretty\""  (1=most important for popularity, 4=least important)\nMoney:   Rank of \""having lots of money\""  (1=most important for popularity, 4=least important)"", ""citation"": ""\n\t\t\t\t@article{OpenML2013,\n\t\t\t\tauthor = {Vanschoren, Joaquin and van Rijn, Jan N. and Bischl, Bernd and Torgo, Luis},\n\t\t\t\ttitle = {OpenML: Networked Science in Machine Learning},\n\t\t\t\tjournal = {SIGKDD Explorations},\n\t\t\t\tvolume = {15},\n\t\t\t\tnumber = {2},\n\t\t\t\tyear = {2013},\n\t\t\t\tpages = {49--60},\n\t\t\t\turl = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2641190.2641198},\n\t\t\t\tdoi = {10.1145/2641190.2641198},\n\t\t\t\tpublisher = {ACM},\n\t\t\t\taddress = {New York, NY, USA},\n\t\t\t\t}"", ""license"": ""CC-BY license"", ""source"": ""OpenML"", ""sourceURI"": ""http://www.openml.org/d/1100"", ""approximateSize"": """", ""datasetSchemaVersion"": ""3.1.1"", ""redacted"": false, ""datasetVersion"": ""1.0""}, ""dataResources"": [{""resID"": ""0"", ""resPath"": ""tables/learningData.csv"", ""resType"": ""table"", ""resFormat"": [""text/csv""], ""isCollection"": false, ""columns"": [{""colIndex"": 0, ""colName"": ""d3mIndex"", ""colType"": ""integer"", ""role"": [""index""]}, {""colIndex"": 1, ""colName"": ""Gender"", ""colType"": ""categorical"", ""role"": [""attribute""]}, {""colIndex"": 2, ""colName"": ""Grade"", ""colType"": ""real"", ""role"": [""attribute""]}, {""colIndex"": 3, ""colName"": ""Age"", ""colType"": ""real"", ""role"": [""attribute""]}, {""colIndex"": 4, ""colName"": ""Race"", ""colType"": ""categorical"", ""role"": [""attribute""]}, {""colIndex"": 5, ""colName"": ""Urban/Rural"", ""colType"": ""categorical"", ""role"": [""attribute""]}, {""colIndex"": 6, ""colName"": ""School"", ""colType"": ""categorical"", ""role"": [""attribute""]}, {""colIndex"": 7, ""colName"": ""Goals"", ""colType"": ""categorical"", ""role"": [""suggestedTarget""]}, {""colIndex"": 8, ""colName"": ""Grades"", ""colType"": ""real"", ""role"": [""attribute""]}, {""colIndex"": 9, ""colName"": ""Sports"", ""colType"": ""real"", ""role"": [""attribute""]}, {""colIndex"": 10, ""colName"": ""Looks"", ""colType"": ""real"", ""role"": [""attribute""]}, {""colIndex"": 11, ""colName"": ""Money"", ""colType"": ""real"", ""role"": [""attribute""]}]}], ""qualities"": null}"
