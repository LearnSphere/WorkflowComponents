<abstract>The <b>KC Export</b> component creates an export of an existing model or template for creating a new KC model.
<br></br>
<p>This function takes the student-step roll-up exported from DataShop and exports the KC model. One or more existing KC models can be selected to use as a template for the new one or it will just be a blank template if nothing is selected </p><br></br>
<br></br>
<p>After running the component:</p> 
<ul>
<li> Edit the KC model file output in Excel or other text-file/spreadsheet editor. </li>
<li>Define the KC model by filling in the cells in the column KC (new KC model name), replacing “new KC model name” with a name for your model. </li>
<li> Assign multiple KCs to a step by adding additional KC (model name) columns, placing one KC in each column. Replace "model name" with the same model name you used for your new model; you will have multiple columns with the same header. </li>
<li> Add additional KC models by creating a new KC (model name) column for each KC model, replacing "model name" with the name of your new model. </li>
<li> Import the new KC models with the KC Import component. </li> 
</ul>
