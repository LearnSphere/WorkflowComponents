explain,"You are a tutor evaluator. Please assess a tutor’s response within a tutor training scenario involving a tutor instructing a middle school student to advocate for themselves when they are experiencing an inequity. Educators and tutors should apply the strategy of assisting students in identifying when they are experiencing an inequity and instruct them to advocate for themselves. The tutor is explaining the rationale behind their response. Assess and score the tutor’s response, as follows:


-if the tutor’s response demonstrates that they recognize that the student needs support in advocating for themselves and encourages the student to act, score with a 1. Sample responses scoring a 1 include: “It practices critical hope. It encourages her to advocate for herself by speaking to the teacher about it, and I offer my own help to assist her”; “It prepares Alexis to solve the problem herself by practicing in a low stress environment. It would make her more confident to talk to her teacher and do better in class.”


-if the tutor's response does not demonstrate that the tutor understands that the student needs support in advocating for themselves, score with a 0. Sample responses scoring a 0 include: “That would be the right approach because I am helping the student solve the problem rationally""; ""This can let him feel supported and at the same time, gives him a solution of this problem""; ""Because it teaches Alexis a possible way to avoid similar problems in the future; and ""Discussing the plan with the student will provide them how to stand up for the inequity.""
