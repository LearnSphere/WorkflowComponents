0
00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:24.038
Now. Um,

1
00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:29.105
so 35 is five times six and five is five times,

2
00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:33.505
whatever this number is. What's five times this number? Like, um,

3
00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:38.425
in other words, five divided by five is, uh, one,

4
00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:47.878
um,

5
00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:48.825
I don't even know. I

6
00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:51.505
Dunno about We'll keep working on it. You'll get the hang of it.

7
00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:59.195
Okay. Um, I think all the students are leaving,

8
00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:05.475
so I think that's just, oh,

9
00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:07.675
There's one more.

10
00:02:09.805 --> 00:02:13.575
Yeah. Um,

11
00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:18.495
I think they're not there though. Okay. Um, did,

12
00:02:18.715 --> 00:02:20.655
was there like any problems or anything?

13
00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:26.335
Um, I have, yeah. No, go. You can go first.

14
00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:29.455
Okay. Okay. Okay. In one of my room,

15
00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:32.695
you don't just go at,

16
00:02:35.965 --> 00:02:37.295
Yeah. I just feel like the,

17
00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:42.015
the connection for pencil is kind of not that stable. Yeah.

18
00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:46.535
Kind of slow. Yeah. Yeah. I sometimes feel like there's a delay between

19
00:02:47.505 --> 00:02:48.435
Yeah. Me

20
00:02:48.595 --> 00:02:50.635
A student and also, um,

21
00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:55.435
when I want to kind of like let them share the screen, I want to go back to the,

22
00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:59.035
uh, board and then when I go back to the screen sharing page,

23
00:03:00.035 --> 00:03:04.745
their page would be blinking like crazily. I don't know why. Yeah.

24
00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:07.345
So just some technical issues there.

25
00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:11.945
Yeah. I think there are a lot of technical issues actually. Like,

26
00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:14.025
I didn't even see any of my kids,

27
00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:18.625
like they weren't able to share their screen at all, so.

28
00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:20.398
Oh my god.

29
00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:25.145
Yeah. So I spent like a good 15 minutes trying to figure that out, but,

30
00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:29.065
Mm-Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hope we can get through that.

31
00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:34.945
I hope so. Um, I also,

32
00:03:35.145 --> 00:03:39.545
I don't know if any of you guys know how to prevent the kids

33
00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:44.105
from unmuting themselves in the main room. I don't know if you guys can do that.

34
00:03:45.965 --> 00:03:46.605
Um,

35
00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:49.185
Uh, I think I'd be able to. I'm not sure

36
00:03:50.295 --> 00:03:54.545
Because when I try and turn off the settings, it doesn't work. Like the kids,

37
00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:57.985
like, were still able to unmute themselves in the main room

38
00:03:59.845 --> 00:04:01.065
and the other guy

39
00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:02.505
You just, you just muted me, right?

40
00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:06.705
Like, I, I just muted you. Like you wanna click that. Um,

41
00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:09.925
There's a video I can, yeah.

42
00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:13.725
Oh no. Um, but there's like a way to like,

43
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:18.325
not let anyone like unmute to begin with because if you have to,

44
00:04:18.965 --> 00:04:21.085
I think there must be something in the settings. Like one.

45
00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:24.005
Yeah, but I don't think it works. I don't know.

46
00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:27.125
The guy like aggressively emailed, like, texted me and was like,

47
00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:31.885
you need to get them to not mute.

48
00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:33.685
And I was like, I dunno

49
00:04:33.705 --> 00:04:34.765
How like whatcha

50
00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:39.445
Telling me to do. Like, okay. I'll figure it out. Okay.

51
00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:43.725
But I guess if there's nothing else, I guess we can leave it now.

52
00:04:44.635 --> 00:04:45.485
Cool. Cool. Cool.

53
00:04:45.595 --> 00:04:46.485
Yeah. Okay.

54
00:04:46.715 --> 00:04:47.805
Hopefully goes. Bye.

55
00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:51.725
Yeah. Hope that could be better. Bye. See you guys.

0
00:13:13.895 --> 00:13:14.728
Hello?

1
00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:19.698
Hi.

2
00:13:19.945 --> 00:13:21.445
Hi. Uh, are you

3
00:13:22.855 --> 00:13:23.235
Doing

4
00:13:23.235 --> 00:13:24.685
Your IL or

5
00:13:26.585 --> 00:13:27.685
I'm doing my IL?

6
00:13:28.395 --> 00:13:29.228
Yeah.

7
00:13:29.745 --> 00:13:30.765
Do you wanna share your

8
00:13:35.175 --> 00:13:38.165
Child? Sixth grade? Lemme know if you have any questions. Cannot.

9
00:13:39.225 --> 00:13:42.085
And if you keep talking, I will not let you go down next period either.

10
00:13:43.505 --> 00:13:45.165
Do your work please. Uh,

11
00:13:45.715 --> 00:13:46.265
Okay.

12
00:13:46.265 --> 00:13:50.565
I'm sitting here watching Stop the racing game.

13
00:13:51.315 --> 00:13:53.045
Assault. You get off the bingo game.

14
00:13:53.225 --> 00:13:54.058
I'm not on bingo.

15
00:13:54.515 --> 00:13:55.445
Says you are right here.

16
00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:58.378
One second.

17
00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:23.988
Okay, I'm back.

18
00:14:34.865 --> 00:14:38.045
Is 5 5 3 positive,

19
00:14:40.645 --> 00:14:41.478
negative.

20
00:14:43.075 --> 00:14:44.565
What is five minus three?

21
00:14:48.465 --> 00:14:49.065
Two

22
00:14:49.065 --> 00:14:50.445
Is two positive or negative.

23
00:14:55.215 --> 00:14:56.565
Y'all keep singing. Go ahead.

24
00:15:00.425 --> 00:15:01.845
Uh, negative

25
00:15:06.285 --> 00:15:07.165
I be so close

26
00:15:20.305 --> 00:15:21.138
the click.

27
00:15:25.505 --> 00:15:29.165
So if we do 68 minus 36, right?

28
00:15:30.145 --> 00:15:30.978
Mm-Hmm.

29
00:15:31.145 --> 00:15:33.205
Do we know it's gonna be bigger than zero?

30
00:15:35.145 --> 00:15:35.845
Yes. So

31
00:15:35.845 --> 00:15:37.365
Would it be positive or negative?

32
00:15:40.165 --> 00:15:40.785
Negative.

33
00:15:40.785 --> 00:15:41.845
If it's bigger than zero.

34
00:15:42.785 --> 00:15:43.805
Oh positive. Yes.

35
00:15:44.345 --> 00:15:47.645
So for these questions, we don't have to like do the math out.

36
00:15:47.705 --> 00:15:52.485
As long as you can figure out if your answer is going to be bigger or

37
00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:53.485
smaller than zero

38
00:16:04.695 --> 00:16:08.405
Three plus negative. So 93,

39
00:16:09.715 --> 00:16:11.285
keep flips of minus

40
00:16:12.025 --> 00:16:17.025
93, 92, 91, 89, 80, 87, 86.

41
00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:28.005
Should it be positive? But yeah, positive?

42
00:16:29.145 --> 00:16:30.645
Yes, it would be positive.

43
00:16:36.205 --> 00:16:37.038
I,

44
00:16:41.585 --> 00:16:44.325
Yes. Okay. One second.

45
00:16:45.365 --> 00:16:47.525
Negative. Um,

46
00:16:49.385 --> 00:16:53.085
but it's going to be higher. So positive.

47
00:16:55.545 --> 00:16:56.378
Oh,

48
00:17:03.945 --> 00:17:07.765
95. So 95

49
00:17:07.895 --> 00:17:08.728
Minus

50
00:17:12.685 --> 00:17:16.885
Positive. Oh, that's negative. Wait,

51
00:17:17.255 --> 00:17:18.088
how's it negative?

52
00:17:23.465 --> 00:17:24.298
Um,

53
00:17:30.665 --> 00:17:33.805
Oh, so if you do negative nine plus

54
00:17:34.245 --> 00:17:35.078
Negative, right?

55
00:17:35.745 --> 00:17:36.578
Yes.

56
00:17:36.785 --> 00:17:40.205
If you add two negative numbers together, does it become positive?

57
00:17:41.265 --> 00:17:42.098
Yes.

58
00:17:42.665 --> 00:17:45.325
If you add two negative numbers together,

59
00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:46.498
Oh, no.

60
00:17:46.985 --> 00:17:50.365
No. Right. So if you add negative nine plus negative nine,

61
00:17:51.185 --> 00:17:52.765
it would still be negative.

62
00:18:01.805 --> 00:18:02.638
Positive.

63
00:18:15.405 --> 00:18:19.805
Positive. Would this be positive? Because like,

64
00:18:20.745 --> 00:18:21.885
if you like switch,

65
00:18:23.805 --> 00:18:25.925
Hmm. So for this one,

66
00:18:28.955 --> 00:18:29.305
Even

67
00:18:29.305 --> 00:18:33.205
If you add eight to it, so, okay.

68
00:18:33.545 --> 00:18:37.885
The only way that a negative number becomes positive is if you add

69
00:18:38.475 --> 00:18:41.045
more than what the negative number has, right?

70
00:18:43.425 --> 00:18:44.285
Can you say it again?

71
00:18:45.155 --> 00:18:45.785
Yeah.

72
00:18:45.785 --> 00:18:50.565
So the only way that this could be positive is whatever you're adding is

73
00:18:50.565 --> 00:18:54.565
greater than the negative number. So is eight greater than 66?

74
00:18:55.545 --> 00:18:56.378
No.

75
00:18:56.545 --> 00:18:58.325
No. Right. So this would still be negative.

76
00:19:05.595 --> 00:19:06.428
That make sense?

77
00:19:07.065 --> 00:19:07.898
Yes.

78
00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:15.788
Okay.

79
00:19:20.835 --> 00:19:22.365
Wait, with aunt,

80
00:19:25.105 --> 00:19:26.285
So this one are you,

81
00:19:26.555 --> 00:19:28.245
Wait, I picked the wrong

82
00:19:34.085 --> 00:19:34.645
Grandpas.

83
00:19:34.645 --> 00:19:35.305
81.

84
00:19:35.305 --> 00:19:39.845
81 90.

85
00:19:42.105 --> 00:19:43.965
So it'll be positive

86
00:19:46.555 --> 00:19:48.445
because it's bigger than zero.

87
00:19:52.265 --> 00:19:52.485
So

88
00:19:52.485 --> 00:19:54.685
It's positive. Will be positive? Yes.

89
00:19:59.195 --> 00:19:59.725
Does

90
00:19:59.725 --> 00:20:01.285
It make sense a little more now?

91
00:20:02.145 --> 00:20:02.978
Yes.

92
00:20:05.425 --> 00:20:09.565
So with this it would be negative because, mm,

93
00:20:10.555 --> 00:20:12.565
well, because you're, so

94
00:20:12.565 --> 00:20:16.445
If you're adding a negative number, you can just think of it as subtracting.

95
00:20:17.545 --> 00:20:20.965
So this would turn into 84 minus 33, right?

96
00:20:21.905 --> 00:20:22.738
Yes.

97
00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:24.525
So would that still be greater than zero?

98
00:20:25.665 --> 00:20:26.498
Yes.

99
00:20:26.665 --> 00:20:27.498
Yes.

100
00:20:36.455 --> 00:20:41.285
43 minus five plus whatever, negative 43.

101
00:20:45.665 --> 00:20:46.235
Do you know

102
00:20:46.235 --> 00:20:49.605
What time your bell rings or what time your period ends?

103
00:20:51.705 --> 00:20:55.765
One second. Mr. Represen.

104
00:20:56.065 --> 00:20:56.898
Excuse me,

105
00:20:58.025 --> 00:21:00.125
Mr, when does this class end?

106
00:21:08.925 --> 00:21:09.965
I think 2 26.

107
00:21:10.515 --> 00:21:12.165
Okay, got it. Just making sure.

108
00:21:16.595 --> 00:21:19.845
Okay. Uh, let's go back to the problem. Sorry, I

109
00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.685
Thought you would, it would just be like a,

110
00:21:23.535 --> 00:21:24.368
Sorry. It's fine. It's fine.

111
00:21:27.265 --> 00:21:30.485
You already got it, so don't worry about that. About yourself.

112
00:21:32.785 --> 00:21:33.618
Uh,

113
00:21:40.215 --> 00:21:41.048
would this piece,

114
00:21:44.005 --> 00:21:44.125
I

115
00:21:44.125 --> 00:21:44.485
Dunno about

116
00:21:44.485 --> 00:21:45.318
This one.

117
00:21:46.635 --> 00:21:49.525
Well, the first number is so much bigger than the second.

118
00:21:50.905 --> 00:21:51.505
Yes.

119
00:21:51.505 --> 00:21:55.085
So if you subtract like a small number from a big number,

120
00:21:55.795 --> 00:21:57.525
it's still gonna be bigger than zero, right?

121
00:21:58.225 --> 00:22:02.165
Yes. Stop singing please.

122
00:22:05.865 --> 00:22:10.205
Oh, you left. My brothers watching YouTube. Yeah, I

123
00:22:12.515 --> 00:22:16.085
anymore, I'm,

124
00:22:17.155 --> 00:22:18.885
he's actually look where she watching.

125
00:22:23.565 --> 00:22:24.398
Positive. Of course.

126
00:22:24.705 --> 00:22:28.645
