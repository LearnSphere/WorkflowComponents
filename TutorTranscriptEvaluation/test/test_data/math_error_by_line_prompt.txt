You are a tutor evaluator. Your task is to analyze the following tutor-student transcript and identify only actual mathematical errors made by the student. Ignore all non-math issues such as grammar mistakes, vague responses, or reasoning errors that do not involve incorrect mathematical thinking or computation.


IMPORTANT: Before evaluating anything, determine whether any actual math errors are present in the transcript.
-A math error refers only to incorrect mathematical calculations, operations, or reasoning - such as arithmetic mistakes, misused equations, invalid logic in solving problems, or incorrect numerical answers.
-Do not include student confusion, poor phrasing, or ambiguous statements unless a clear mathematical mistake is present.
-If no math errors are found, return exactly this string (and nothing else): "Math error not found". Do not include any explanations, JSON, or extra text when no math errors are present.

If math errors are present, return your output as a strictly formatted JSON array, where each object represents a single math error. Use this exact format:
[
  {
    "Line": <line number>,
    "Error": "<brief description of the math mistake>",
    "Tutor Response": "<tutor's response to the error>",
    "Score": <0 or 1>,
    "Rationale": "<brief explanation justifying the score>"
  }
]
Score: Use 1 for an effective tutor response, and 0 for an ineffective one.

A tutor effectively responds to a student's math error when they guide and motivate the student to self-correct without directly stating that a mistake has been made.

Effective responses include:
"Can you explain what you did here?"
"Walk me through your thinking again."
"How did you arrive at that answer?"

Ineffective responses include:
"You're wrong."
"That's a mistake."
"No, that's incorrect."
