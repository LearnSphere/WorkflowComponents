Find the Whole 
Country music makes up 75\% of a person's music library. 
If they have downloaded 90 country music songs, how many songs do they have in their music library? 
Think About It! 

A classmate claims that because \( 75 \% \) is less than 100, the person should have more than 90 music songs in their library. Do you think this reasoning is correct? Why or why not? 

Begin by identifying the part, the whole, and the percent. 
part: 
whole: 
percent:  \( \% \)

hi 
Hi how are you/ 
great what about you 
doing well thx :) 
could you share your question on the board? 
sure can you plz wait for like 1 minute 
take ur time! 
ok give me a few minutes, so I can take a look :) 
ok for this one we need to find 75% of 90 
which is 90 times 0.75 
can you calculate this? 
67.5 
correct, great job! 
oh wait 
my bad 
actually 75% is 90 country songs 
if A is the number of songs in the library, 
then 75% of A is equal to 90 
so A times 0.75 = 90 
then A is 90 divided by 0.75 
can you calculate 90 divided by 0.75? 
120. 
great job, correct! 
are you there 
Yes 
Do you have other questions? 
I put it on the board 
Ok let me take a look 
ok part is 90 
whole is unknown 
and percent is 90% 
does this make sense? 
yes 
great! 
can we move on? 
yes 
ok what's next? :) 
it on the board 
about the bar diagram? 
that looks correct 
ok what's next question? :) 
that was the last one but thank you for all your help today 
my pleasure 
have a great day! :)
