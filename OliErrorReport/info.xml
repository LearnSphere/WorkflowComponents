<abstract><p>The <b>OliErrorReport</b> component can transform a oli content csv file (output from the OliContentExtractor Component)
and a transaction data txt file into a Datashop formatted csv file with error reports for every question and its choices.</p>
<p>The required input fields are a csv file that is the output of the OliContentExtractor component and a Datashop transaction data txt file.
</p>
<p>There is one type of output: a csv file called error_report.csv. This csv file contains activity id, question id, total observations, question content, input count
  and percentage, and input evaluation. These are organized every row by question id. The input count and percentage list out the choice content and the number/percentage
  or responses for that choice. The input evaluation is the feedback for every choice.
