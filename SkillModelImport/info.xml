<abstract>This component will import a skill, or Knowledge Component (KC), model into DataShop. For more information on DataShop KC models see <a target="_blank" href="https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/help?page=kcm">this help page.</a> It includes specifics for both the input and export formats, as well as guidance on creating new models.

<inputs>
  <b>KC model</b>A tab-delimited file defining a new skill model. This input is typically generated by exporting an existing skill model from a dataset and modifying it to generate a new model.<br/> The required format for this file is:
  <ul>
    <li>Step ID</li>
    <li>One or more columns with the header identifying the new model, e.g., KC (New Model Name)</li>    
  </ul>
  The 'Step ID' values must match the dataset.
  <br/>
  The component will attempt to import all models defined in the input file, ignoring those with names that already exist in the dataset.
  <br/>  
</inputs>

<outputs>
  <b>Skill model values</b>The modeling results of importing the new skill model, e.g., AIC, BIC.
  <br/>
  <b>DataShop KC model</b>The model export, which aggregates data across students for each step.
  <br/>
  <b>Note: </b> If more than one model is imported, the output files will be zip files containing the model-values and kcm-exports for all of the imported models.
</outputs>

<options>
<b>Dataset id</b> - Parameter that specifies the database id of the DataShop dataset the KC model should imported into.<br/>
</options>
