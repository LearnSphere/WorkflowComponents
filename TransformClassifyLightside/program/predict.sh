# Usage: scripts/predict.sh path/to/saved/model.xml [{data-encoding} path/to/unlabeled/data.csv...]
# Outputs tab-separated predictions for new instances, using the given model. (instance number, prediction, text)
# If no new data file is given, instances are read from the standard input.
# Common tab encodings are UTF-8, windows-1252, and MacRoman.
# (Make sure that the text columns and any columns used as features 
#  have the same names in the new data as they did in the training set.)
