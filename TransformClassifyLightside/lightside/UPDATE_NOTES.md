Note: to upgrade weka I had to do the following:
  * get the latest weka.jar file into lib
  * use java -jar lib/weka.jar
  * use the package manager to install libLinear, LibSVM, ...
  * move wekafiles from my home directory into lightside directory
  * download mtj.jar, ... etc. and also put in lib (because of this problem: https://web.archive.org/web/20170519101449/https://list.waikato.ac.nz/pipermail/wekalist/2017-February/068928.html)
