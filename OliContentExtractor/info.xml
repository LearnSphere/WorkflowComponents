<abstract><p>The <b>OliContentExtractor</b> component can transform xml files from oli workbook and inline assessments into a Datashop formatted csv file
with unit, module, title, activity id, question content, choice content, and feedback content. </p>
<p>The required field is a zip file named "input" that contains two directories: "content" and organizations". The "content" directory must contain a folder with workbook xml files ("x-oli-workbook_page")
  and a folder with inline-assessments xml files ("x-oli-inline-assessment"). The "organizations" directory must contain a folder called "default" that has a file called "organization.xml".
</p>
<p>There is one type of output: a csv file called oli_content.csv. This csv file contains unit, module, title, activity id, question content, choice content, and feedback content.
  These are organized in rows by unit name. Each workbook page is searched for activities. Each activity found has question content as well as choice content. The feedback
  content shows the user which choice is correct/incorrect and the explanation for it.
