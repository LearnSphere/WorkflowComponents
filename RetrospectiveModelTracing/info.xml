<abstract>
<p>Component Retrospective Model Tracing provides two approaches for model-tracing:</p>
<p><b>The typical/simple model-tracing approach penalizes learners for all the errors they make in a submission.</b>
<ul>
<li>This approach treats every error as an individual observation with a KC, regardless of whether multiple errors are made within a single submission.</li>
<li>As a result, if a student makes several errors in a single attempt, each error contributes to the total count of observations.</li>
<li>This can inflate the number of observations with KCs, since multiple errors in a single submission are counted separately.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>The retrospective model-tracing approach only penalizes learners for the first error they make in a submission.</b>
<ul>
<li>This method focuses on the first error made in a submission and does not count subsequent errors in the same submission.</li>
<li>It assumes that the first error is the most significant learning moment, and subsequent errors are a consequence of the first.</li>
<li>By penalizing only the first error, the number of observations with KCs is reduced because only the initial mistake is considered a learning opportunity.</li>
</ul>
