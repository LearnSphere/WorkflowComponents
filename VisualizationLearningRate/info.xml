<abstract>This component fits one of three student models (AFM, iAFM, or t-AFM) and returns student or KC learning curve fits represented graphically with one line in log-odds scale for each student/KC and numerically with learning rate and initial knowledge parameters for each student/KC.
<p>The component offers three student models:
<ol>
<li>AFM is the Additive Factors Model and considers a slope and intercept for each KC, and an intercept for each student.</li>
<li>iAFM is the Individualized Additive Factors Model and considers a slope and intercept for each KC and for each student.</li>
<li>t-AFM is similar to iAFM but instead of considering opportunity count as the measure of progression over which slope is calculated, it uses total calendar time spent on practice.</li>
