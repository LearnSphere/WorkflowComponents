<abstract><p>The <b>OliPerformance</b> component can transform problem data into a Datashop formatted csv file with student performance on oli courses.</p>
<p>The required input fields are three checkboxes for if the user wants to include the specified csv file in the output zip file.
</p>
<p>There is one type of output: a zip file called ResultFiles. The zip file contains three csvs: activities_per_module.csv, student_quiz.csv, and student_act.csv.
  The first csv (activities_per_module) sorts oli questions from each module into "Did I get this" and "Learn By Doing". The second csv (student_quiz) shows
  student performance relative to attempts, final score, quiz score, first attempt correct, and quiz steps by problem heirarchy. The third csv (student_act) shows
  student performance relative to incorrect attempts, correct attemps, first attempts, problems, and ls by problem heirarchy on activities.
